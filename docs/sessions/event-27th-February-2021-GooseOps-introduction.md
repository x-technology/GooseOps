# Introducing GooseOps - Handy toolset for adoption DevOps practices into a startup project

### Date And Time
Sat, February 27th, 2021 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM MSK

### Description

Hi, I'm Andrew. For the last 10+ years I was a developer working with multiple languages, such as C++, C#, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Node.JS.
Over this time I participated in different projects from garage startups to FinTech giants and Banking Software.
For now, I'm mostly concerned about cloud computing and golang development. 

I will be sharing a lot of interesting things about Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and using DevOps for automation build, test, deploy flows into an open source project. So, please stay tuned!

Project #3 — GooseOps - https://github.com/x-technology/GooseOps

Every time I come into a new company or start a new project, I raise the same problems about making infrastructure and CI/CD for it.
That’s why I decided to create a common template, which helps to build those things even faster. Let’s build it here together! 
Most of the developers use Docker and Kubernetes in their daily tasks. Could we make it better? You never know, so let’s try!

What might we need for a devops project?

- access to any cloud provider: AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud.
- basic understanding of Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.
- one of the commonly used CI/CD: Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Bitbucket.

During the event we will cover following topics:
- Starting to work with Docker for local development.
- Tips to save your time with Docker.
- Diving into Kubernetes, k8s annotations, `kubectl` tricks.
- Introducing Infrastructure As Code with Terraform.
- Starting to work with Terraform to set up a private Kubernetes cluster.

We invite you to join our session on February 27th, 2021 and have some fun together.
